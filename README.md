<h1>Project06 Description</h1>

<strong><em>Complete    </em></strong>the      provided        partial C++     program         that     will      implement     a<strong><em>          </em></strong><strong><em>Graph ADT    Class   </em></strong>in         which  an        <strong><em>Adjacency      List</em></strong><strong><em>     </em></strong>as        the      internal          representation           of         the      graph  structure.<strong><em>                   </em></strong>

The  lecture notes   and      textbook         provide           the      source code    for       basic   graph  methods         and      the      DFS     and        BFS     algorithms     but      you      will      need    to         modify            this      code    to         complete        this      assignment.

Required     modifications include

<ul>

 <li>conversion to         use      an        adjacency       list       representation</li>

 <li>addition of         the      specified         exception       detection/handling</li>

 <li>conversion to         use      the      <strong><em>stack</em></strong>   and      <strong><em>queue</em></strong> containers      from    the      Standard        Template                                    Additional      details may     be        found  on        pages  4-5      of         the      handout          (see     <strong><em>Project06       Hints</em></strong>).</li>

<h1>Running the Sample Solution on blackhawk or the laboratory Linux machines</h1>

<strong><em>The  best     description    of         what   your    code    must   do        is         the      </em></strong><strong><em>Sample           Solution</em></strong><strong><em>         for       the      project.</em></strong>

Run  the      sample            solution          by        typing the      following        at         <strong>blackhawk</strong>    terminal         window          command        prompt           where <strong>inputfilename</strong>     is         the      name   of         one      of         the      provided        input   files     (for        example,         <strong><em>p06input1.txt</em></strong>).

<strong>/home/work/cpe212/project06/p06   inputfilename </strong>

Your current           working          directory        must   contain           the      input   files     for       this      to         work.

<h1>Unzipping Sample Input Files on blackhawk</h1>

Use  the      Firefox            browser          to         access Canvas            and      download       <strong>main.cpp</strong>       and      the      sample        input   files     into     your    <strong>Project06</strong>      directory.                   At        terminal         window          prompt,          use      the        unzip  utility  to         uncompress   the      files.                For      example,         to         unzip  the      files     into     your    current        directory:

<strong>unzip  Project06_Materials.zip </strong>

Since            this      project            is         worth  four     points, you      have    been    given   four     input   files     to         test      your        program.

<h1>Running the Preview Script on blackhawk</h1>

Preconditions         for       running          the      Preview          script:

<ul>

 <li><strong><em>Your current          working         directory       must   contain          both    your    </em></strong><strong><em>project06</em></strong><strong><em>       executable     and     all  sample           input  files</em></strong><strong><em>     </em></strong><strong><em>BEFORE</em></strong><strong><em>          you     execute          the      preview          script!!!          </em></strong></li>

 <li>Linux is         case     sensitive         –          be        sure    the      name   of         your    executable      is                                 <strong><em>project06</em></strong></li>

</ul>




Run  the      preview          script  by        typing the      following        in         a          <strong>blackhawk</strong>    terminal         window          command        prompt

<strong>/home/work/cpe212data/project06/preview06.bash      </strong>




This script  will      run      both    the      Sample           Solution          AND    your    project06       executable      program         on        the        complete        set       of         input   files,    and      it          compares       the      outputs           of         the      two     programs       line        by        line      to         identify           errors in         your    program’s      outputs.                      Make   sure    that     the      output of        your    program         exactly            matches          the      output of         the      Sample           Solution.




<h1>Program Compilation Instructions</h1>

This project            consists          of         two     C++     files     provided        by        the      instructor,      along   with    a          file        named <strong>makefile</strong>        to         help     you      compile          your    program.                    So,       for       this      assignment,    all        you        must   do        to         compile          the      program         is         to         use      the      following        command       at         the        Linux  command       line      <strong>make  </strong>which  will      create an        executable      named            <strong>project06</strong>      from    the      provided        files.




If      your    program         compiled        successfully,   you      may     then    type

<strong>./project06                                    NameOfInputFile     </strong>to         execute           your    program         assuming        that     the      input        file       is         located            in         the      same   directory        with    the      executable.

<h1>Project06 Include File Constraints **</h1>

All    allowed          include           files     within graph.cpp       appear below:

<strong>#include    “graph.h”      </strong>

<strong>#include                &lt;stack&gt;          </strong>

<strong>#include                &lt;queue&gt;        </strong>

Use  of         the      Standard        Template        Library           containers      or        container        adapters         (other than    <strong><em>stack</em></strong>   and        <strong><em>queue</em></strong>)            is         not      allowed.          Includes          for       stack   and      queue appear within <strong>graph.h</strong>

<h1>Project06 Hints</h1>

You  will      be        better  prepared        for       the      Final   Exam  if          you      can      write   the      <strong>Graph ADT</strong>    code    on        your    own     rather than    just      copying           code    from    the      textbook         or        lecture notes   since   the      written        exams are      CLOSED          BOOK  and      CLOSED          NOTES.

When          adapting         the      code    provided        during lecture,           you      will      need    to         make   modifications to        convert           the      code    to         work   with    the      <strong>Adjacency     List</strong>     representation           of         a          graph.             The        <strong>VertexExists</strong> and      <strong>EdgeExists                </strong>methods         take     the      place   of         the      <strong>IndexIs</strong>          method           since        there   is         <strong>NO      ARRAY           IN        THIS   PROJECT</strong>!!!

For   help     with    the      <strong>stack</strong>  and      <strong>queue</strong> containers      from    the      Standard        Template        Library,          see      the        lecture notes.<strong>  </strong>
